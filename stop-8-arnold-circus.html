  <h1>Stop 8 – Arnold Circus / Boundary Estate</h1>
  <p><em>130 years of housing cycles: slum clearance, social housing, gentrification.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop looks at Arnold Circus and the Boundary Estate as one of the first major
    council housing schemes in London, built on the cleared Old Nichol slum in the
    1890s.[web:95][web:96][web:100]
  </p>
  <p>
    We trace how the estate moved from housing the “deserving poor” and Jewish tenants
    to later Bangladeshi families, and how it is now under pressure from gentrification
    and right‑to‑buy sales – echoing the wider housing story you’ve seen all along this
    tour.[web:95][web:99][web:101]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Boundary Estate was built between about 1894 and 1900, replacing around 15 acres of Old Nichol slums and displacing over 5,000 residents.[web:95][web:96][web:105]</li>
    <li>Rents in the new estate were too high for most former slum dwellers, so many original residents were pushed further east into new overcrowded areas.[web:95][web:96][web:101]</li>
    <li>Over the 20th century tenants included Jews fleeing pogroms and Nazism and later Bangladeshi families; today, the estate is mixed council, housing association and private, and residents have twice fought off attempts to transfer or sell blocks to other landlords.[web:95][web:99][web:101]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When a housing scheme improves building standards but displaces most previous residents, is that social progress or just a different kind of injustice?[web:95][web:101]</li>
    <li>How do the housing struggles you’ve heard about – from BHAG squats to Save Brick Lane – change how you see “fashionable” places like this today?[web:99][web:108]</li>
  </ul>
