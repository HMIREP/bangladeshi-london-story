  <h1>Stop 6 – Bangla Town (Brick Lane Restaurants)</h1>
  <p><em>From curry capital to sharp decline under gentrification.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop looks at the rise of “Bangla Town” in the 1990s–2000s, when Brick Lane became
    famous for its Bangladeshi‑run curry houses, and at the steep decline in those
    restaurants over the last 15–20 years.[web:66][web:70][web:71]
  </p>
  <p>
    We connect this to changing rents and business rates, competition from new food
    venues and chains, and the way cultural success made the street attractive to
    developers and tourists but harder for local restaurateurs to survive.[web:66][web:72][web:73]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In the mid‑2000s, Banglatown had around 60 Bangladeshi‑ or Pakistani‑owned curry restaurants and cafés on Brick Lane and Osborn Street.[web:66][web:70][web:71]</li>
    <li>By early 2020, researchers counted only 23 such outlets – a drop of about 62% in 15 years.[web:66][web:70][web:71]</li>
    <li>Owners report big rent and business‑rate hikes, competition from the Truman Brewery food court and nearby “hipster” cafés, and difficulties recruiting chefs due to visa rules.[web:66][web:72][web:77]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How can a street go from being marketed as “Banglatown” to losing most of its Bangladeshi restaurants within a generation?[web:66][web:71]</li>
    <li>Who benefits when an area’s migrant food culture makes it famous, and who pays the price when the rents rise afterwards?[web:73][web:78]</li>
  </ul>
