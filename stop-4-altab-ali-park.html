  <h1>Stop 4 – Altab Ali Park</h1>
  <p><em>From racist murder to mass march and anti‑fascist organising.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop tells the story of Altab Ali, a 24‑year‑old Bangladeshi garment worker
    murdered nearby in May 1978, and how his death triggered a 7,000‑strong march from
    here to Downing Street led largely by young Bengalis.[file:43]
  </p>
  <p>
    We connect that moment to a longer history of racist attacks in the East End, the
    presence of the National Front, and to later anti‑fascist organising in the 1990s,
    including the Quddus Ali case you heard about at Stop 1.[file:43]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Altab Ali was killed on 4 May 1978 while walking home from work along the edge of this park.[file:43]</li>
    <li>Ten days later, around 7,000 people marched from here to Downing Street, carrying his coffin at the front.[file:43]</li>
    <li>The park was renamed Altab Ali Park in 1998, and now includes a Shaheed Minar‑inspired memorial arch.[file:43]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What turns a community from being a target of racist violence into a political force that can rename parks and reshape a borough?[file:43]</li>
    <li>How do you think the memory of 1978 shaped later anti‑fascist organising on Brick Lane in the 1990s and beyond?[file:43]</li>
  </ul>
