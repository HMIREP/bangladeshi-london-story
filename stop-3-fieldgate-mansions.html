  <h1>Stop 3 – Fieldgate Mansions / Pelham Buildings</h1>
  <p><em>From “we need a place to worship” to “we need a place to live”.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop looks at the Bengali Housing Action Group (BHAG) and the 1970s squatting
    movement in Pelham Buildings and Fieldgate Mansions, when Bengali families occupied
    empty council‑owned flats to escape dangerous private rentals and racist attacks.[file:43]
  </p>
  <p>
    We explore how organised squatting, housing lists and legal pressure forced the Greater
    London Council to grant tenancies and recognise a “safe Bengali living area” around
    Brick Lane – a key moment in making the Bangladeshi East End.[file:43]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>By the mid‑1970s, dozens of Bengali families were squatting in these blocks, many fleeing overcrowded and unsafe private housing.[file:43]</li>
    <li>BHAG formed in 1976, led by Bengali tenants with support from activists such as Mala Sen, Farrukh Dhondy and Terry Fitzpatrick.[file:43]</li>
    <li>Around 1977 the GLC agreed an amnesty: families could stay and were given proper council tenancies in and around these buildings.[file:43]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When is breaking into an empty flat an act of survival rather than “crime” – and who gets to decide?[file:43]</li>
    <li>What parallels can you see between BHAG’s struggle in the 1970s and current fights over social housing and gentrification in London?[file:43]</li>
  </ul>
