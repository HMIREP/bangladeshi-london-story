  <h1>Stop 7 – Truman Brewery / Save Brick Lane</h1>
  <p><em>How a historic brewery became ground zero for gentrification – and resistance.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop looks at the Old Truman Brewery at the southern end of Brick Lane and the
    long‑running fight over plans to redevelop it into offices, retail and now a data
    centre with a small number of flats.[web:80][web:84][web:85]
  </p>
  <p>
    We focus on the Save Brick Lane campaign – a coalition of local traders, residents and
    heritage groups – and how their organising links back to earlier struggles over
    housing, culture and who Brick Lane is really for.[web:82][web:89][web:91]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers have proposed schemes including a shopping‑mall and corporate office block, and more recently a data centre plus 44 flats (only a minority for social rent).[web:80][web:85][web:84]</li>
    <li>More than 7,000 objections were submitted against earlier Truman Brewery plans, alongside petitions and letters from traders and residents.[web:85][web:89]</li>
    <li>In 2025 Tower Hamlets councillors voted to oppose the latest redevelopment plans; a public inquiry and legal challenges, led in part by Save Brick Lane, are still ongoing.[web:84][web:86][web:90][web:91]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What does “regeneration” mean when a development risks pushing out the very communities and businesses that made Brick Lane famous?[web:88][web:92]</li>
    <li>How is the Save Brick Lane campaign repeating – or updating – the tactics of BHAG and earlier anti‑gentrification struggles in the East End?[web:82][web:86][web:94]</li>
