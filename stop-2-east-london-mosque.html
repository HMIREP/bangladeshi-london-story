  <h1>Stop 2 – East London Mosque</h1>
  <p><em>The institutional backbone: how a mosque became a borough’s anchor.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop looks at the East London Mosque as the institutional heart of the Bangladeshi
    and wider Muslim community in Tower Hamlets – a place built through donations,
    organising and struggle rather than state generosity.[file:43]
  </p>
  <p>
    We connect the mosque to the wider story of migration in this area and to the fact that
    Tower Hamlets now has the highest proportion of Muslim and Bangladeshi residents of
    any local authority in England and Wales.[file:43]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The mosque’s roots go back to early 20th‑century organising; the current complex opened in stages from the 1980s onward.[file:43]</li>
    <li>According to the 2021 Census, about 39.9% of Tower Hamlets residents identify as Muslim – the highest share in England and Wales.[file:43]</li>
    <li>Roughly a third of the borough’s residents identify as Bangladeshi, again the highest proportion for any local authority in the UK.[file:43]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What does it mean for a borough when its main mosque is also a school, welfare hub and political meeting space?[file:43]</li>
    <li>How does calling this “one of the most Muslim, most Bangladeshi places in Britain” change how you see the streets around it?[file:43]</li>
  </ul>
