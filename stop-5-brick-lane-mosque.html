  <h1>Stop 5 – Brick Lane Mosque (59 Brick Lane)</h1>
  <p><em>One building, three faiths: Huguenots → Jews → Bangladeshis.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop uses 59 Brick Lane – now the Brick Lane Jamme Masjid – to show how
    successive migrant communities have made the East End their own: first French
    Huguenot weavers, then Eastern European Jews, and now Bangladeshi Muslims.[web:51][web:53][web:55]
  </p>
  <p>
    We also touch on how Jewish dominance of the garment trade passed to Bengali
    workers and business owners from the 1960s–70s, turning old sweatshops into the
    economic base of the Bangladeshi East End.[web:56][web:62]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The building at 59 Brick Lane was erected in the 1740s as a Huguenot chapel, then became a Methodist church, later the Spitalfields Great Synagogue, and since the 1970s a mosque.[web:51][web:53][web:55]</li>
    <li>Jewish tailors and machinists dominated the local “rag trade” from the late 19th century until after World War II, when many families moved to North London suburbs.[web:56][web:62]</li>
    <li>From the 1960s onwards, Bengali migrants increasingly worked in and then took over clothing and leather factories in and around Brick Lane, inheriting that industrial base.[web:56][web:62]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What does it mean that the same building has served Huguenot Protestants, Jewish congregants and Bangladeshi Muslims in turn?[web:51][web:53]</li>
    <li>How does seeing this layered history affect the way you think about who “belongs” on Brick Lane today?[web:57][web:63]</li>
