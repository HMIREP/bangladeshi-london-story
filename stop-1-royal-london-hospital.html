  <h1>Stop 1 – Royal London Hospital / Tower Hamlets Town Hall</h1>
  <p><em>Beginnings: birth, migration, and how this borough becomes home.</em></p>

  <h2>What this stop covers</h2>
  <p>
    This stop connects my own birth at the Royal London Hospital, my father’s journey as a
    merchant seaman, and the much longer history of migrant patients, workers and residents
    who passed through this building and this borough.[file:43]
  </p>
  <p>
    We also introduce the Quddus Ali case in the 1990s and ask how a place marked by racist
    violence ends up with a Bangladeshi mayor and MPs – and what that does and doesn’t
    change about everyday life.[file:43]
  </p>

  <h2>Key facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Royal London began life in the 18th century as one of Britain’s earliest public / charitable hospitals.[file:43]</li>
    <li>Tower Hamlets today has one of the highest proportions of Muslim and Bangladeshi residents of any local authority in England and Wales.[file:43]</li>
    <li>The former hospital building now houses Tower Hamlets Town Hall, where decisions about housing, planning and services for this community are made.[file:43]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions to bring with you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What happens when your own birth place is also a site of racist attacks and protests – how does that shape your sense of belonging?[file:43]</li>
    <li>When a hospital becomes a town hall, what really changes about who has power and who doesn’t in a borough like this?[file:43]</li>
  </ul>
